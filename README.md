The "Smart Negotiation Analysis for Local Vendors" project leverages advanced data analytics to empower local vendors with insights for optimizing supplier negotiations, pricing strategies, and customer targeting.

The "Smart Negotiation Analysis for Local Vendors" project successfully delivers a robust framework for data-driven decision-making. By integrating DMart, retail sales, and customer data, it provides insights into customer behavior, product profitability, and pricing strategies. The Vendor Negotiation Intelligence Dashboard enhances accessibility, enabling vendors to act on these insights efficiently. Key outcomes include:
- Identification of high-value customer segments for targeted marketing.
- Highlighting low-margin products for supplier negotiations.
- Dynamic pricing suggestions to maximize demand.
- Statistical evidence of varying discount strategies across categories.

The project empowers local vendors to negotiate better terms, optimize pricing, and engage customers effectively, fostering long-term profitability. Future enhancements include A/B testing for pricing, real-time data integration, and expanding the dashboard with additional features like inventory tracking.
